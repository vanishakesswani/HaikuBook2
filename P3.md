Other String manipulators:
uppercase : This makes all text changes to UPPERCASE, which may be useful if you want all uppercase characters entered by the user to ignore case-sensitivity.
showpoint  : This can display the decimal point and there is no point in front of it to add to remove the decimal point
showpos : This shows a positive sign of all numbers, and there is no negative sign that can be added in front of it.
unitbuf : This refreshes the file like a normal flush operator, except that the file is flushed after each insert.
scientific : This converts all numbers to scientific notation, which is useful when dealing with large numbers or small numbers.
left - This aligns all text to the left by adding padding at the right position.
right - This aligns all text to the right by adding padding at the left position.
internal - This aligns text a certain way by adding padding in the middle position (some text go right, while others go left).

we are trying to design a fixed-size record, accessing the data will be important and I will use a vector. The main drawback of vectors is that adding elements will be slow, but this is not important because there is a fixed size. The vector is also really good at accessing elements by index and iterating in order. We can read the entire vector by using the data () function and a single element using the at () function. You can also do this by using the pointer * p to point to a location and * p to a value.
